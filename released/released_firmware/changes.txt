1930 - Workaround for spiky strain gauge readings. Second sample is taken.
1926 - Increased temperature cutout to 60 dec
1911 - Shortened code by removing some tests. See if the bootloader likes this now.
1909 - New straingauge tracking algorithm. New jiggling algorithm.
1903 - Sampling voltage. Enabled message rollover
1816 - Added coupled jiggle algorithm.
1802 - Integral wind-down enabled.
