ros-indigo-sr-robot-lib (1.4.0-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Skip reset gains for arm controllers
  * Skip reset_gains if the controller is a trajectory controller
  * Fix diagnostics prefix
  * Add muscle hand joint prefix
  * Fix ns for controller resetting
  * Use joint_prefix in order to get the right actuator from the hardware_interface.
  * Set node handle for the tactile classes. Prefix the diagnostics.
  * Set node handle from ouside the robot_lib. Prefix the diagnostics.
  * Add ns_prefix and joint_prefix to hand devices.
  * UBI0.cpp, sr_motor_robot_lib.cpp and sr_muscle_robot_lib now match upstream
    Removed sr_bringup as calibration file is now in ros_ethercat
  * Increased UBI0 timeout to 10 seconds
  * Now mid prox data are still extracted in UBI0 update, but do not require that the from_sensor_data_type is correct (as it is in fact incorrect when there is no distal tactile sensor connected)
  * Added a 5s timeout to the tactile initialization. In case no tactiles are detected, we assume that we have UBI0 tactiles. This is a temporary solution that allow us to extract the middle, proximal and palm sensors even if no tactiles are plugged in
