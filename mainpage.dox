\b sr_edc_launch contains the launch files to start the needed nodes for the Shadow Robot EtherCAT hand.

To start the Hand driver:
\code{.sh}
roslaunch sr_edc_launch sr_edc.launch
\endcode

The actual config to use (etherCAT port, etc...) should be defined in the sr_config/bashrc/env_variables.bashrc file (to ensure you can easily upgrade your different stacks).
